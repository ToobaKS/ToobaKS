## Hi there! I'm Tooba 👋

👀 I’m interested in starting my career as a software engineer! <br>
🌱 I’m a software engineering graduate from Carleton University and BrainStation. <br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can continue to grow and expand on the skills I've learned. <br>
📫 How to reach me: Send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tooba-sheikh) 🙂 <br>
😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers <br>
⚡ Fun fact: I love to read, watch anime in my spare time. And I have been really into crocheting little plushies. <br>
